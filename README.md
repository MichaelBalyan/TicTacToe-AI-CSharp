# Tic-Tac-Toe with Smart AI (C#)

A professional implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an intelligent AI opponent.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Strategic AI:** The algorithm doesn't just make random moves; it calculates offensive and defensive strategies.
- **Draw Prediction Logic:** The engine can detect if the game will inevitably end in a draw before all cells are filled, saving time on pointless moves.
- **Clean Code:** Written in C# with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🧠 How the AI Works
The AI evaluates the board state to:
1. Identify immediate winning moves.
2. Block the player's potential winning lines.
3. Analyze if a win is still possible for either side (Early Draw Detection).
